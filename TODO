✔️ All paramaters need to be passed into a funciton

* Orders for uptick()
    ✔️ No fractional orders
    ✔️ Make sure run() orders don't exceed cash balance

* Some types seem to be functioning strangely
    * Need to fix the crazy large order sizes

* Write all data ending to LOG files
    ✔️ Make sure that the market continues to test after training
    * Save updated parameters to CSV
    * Append asset price data to CSV after each tick

✔️ Data visualization
    * Add Volume bars on the bottom
    * Correlation Matrixes
    * Real DOW30 vs Sim DOW30
        * Compare w/ total number of each type of trader depending on DOW conditions.

* Update Model Training Data
    * Train on 50%, test w/ 50%

✔️ Push to GIT

# FIXME:
* Assets not saving to CSV
* Price expectations too high (causing large purchases)

# TODO:
* Type Evaluations & Type Choosing
    * Make sure type-dependent variables are adjusted. 
    * Make sure to recalculate scores (should be done in market.py)
    * And calculate the change in wealth for each agent as they are upticked and append to the appropriate list.

# Possible Problems/Solutions

* Universal Risk Aversion being too low
    * Causes high optimal_shares
    * Try: Generating random # from normal probability distribution.

✔️❗ sum on price expectations for Momentum Traders & Contrarians is adding up to >1 (still w/in tolerable range)

✔️ Make sure paramters (not extrapolation_degree) cannot be negative

✔️ Gradient is way too steep

✔️ TODO: FIXME: !!! Score isn't calculated correctly
✔️ TODO: After each tick, record params

* TODO: Make sure extrapolation_degree is corrected after each 
* TODO: Have start generated on normal distribution that has been found to be condiutive to buying
